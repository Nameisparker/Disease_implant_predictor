# Medibuddy: Smart Disease Predictor

Introduction:

Medibuddy is a smart disease predictor app that uses machine learning algorithms to diagnose diseases based on user's symptoms and health history. The main goal of this project is to design an application that can accurately predict the outcome or presence of the disease.
to predict the severity of various diseases. The user can input symptoms and
demographic information, which are then used by our algorithm to generate an
accurate prediction for their condition.

Getting started with the project:

- Clone this repository onto your local system.for eg- "git clone <link>"
- Open up terminal/command prompt in the root directory (where requirements.txt exists).
- Run command "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will automatically install all necessary packages required for the project.
- To run the application locally on your computer, open up another terminal window and navigate into the 'medibuddy' folder using cd medibuddy/. Then type python3manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 . You should now be able to access the website on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or any other IP address you have specified if it's not localhost.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
